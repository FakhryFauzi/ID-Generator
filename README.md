# ID-Generator
A simple java function that generates a unique Id based on the name we input

Introduction:

The ID-Generator is a simple function in java that I regularly refer to in order to generate unique IDs. 

These IDs are usually used alongside MySQL and Hashmaps as their key and to easily track them

In this simple ID-Generator we use:

1.) for loops

2.) time generators (which I usually use also for debugging and performance testing when miliseconds are used)

3.) splitting of strings into individual characters
